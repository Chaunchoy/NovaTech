Models
==== 
This directory contains all the models used for our vehicle and its insturctions to build the vehicle. Since our robot is made out of LEGO technic pieces, we are going to be 3d printing mounts and adapters for the sensors. Below is a table of our 3D-printed parts and what they are used for.

| File Name | Description | Image | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| MG310 Lego Adapter.stl | Provides a strong and secure joint between LEGO® cross-axles/holes and MG310P20 7.4V L motor, making hybrid builds more easy to attach. | ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a703c20-329f-4ef1-8bbf-1d14ed25af2a) |
| PCB Base Plate.stl | Acts as the main structural plate where components such as main panels , sensors and motors can be fixed in a place. It also strong yet thin, providing a stable chassis without adding too much weight. | ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45697f9d-7a69-4a3b-b866-b25ec981decd) |
| TCS Adapter.stl | It acts as a connector between LEGO® Technic parts and non-LEGO® components (TCS3472 Colour Sensor) | ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bba9efe-1e79-410d-a815-aec42dc09f2a) |
| VL5130.stl | Holds the VL53 sensor breakout board firmly without stress on the pins. They also works as case shields for the VL53LOX ToF Sensors from shocks or misalignment. | ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df54797c-acd8-4758-b8b5-ef88a735b242) |
